# LCM4ESP32
life-cycle-manager for ESP32

early stages of porting https://github.com/HomeACcessoryKid/life-cycle-manager to ESP32  
do not use before it reaches v1.0.0 unless you feel like experimenting together with me  
All documentation about strategy is at [LCM](https://github.com/HomeACcessoryKid/life-cycle-manager) for now  
Intention to use many native components of ESP32 like esp_http_client and ota concepts  
Initial testing show that they can be useful.  
native_ota_example seems useful too.
